# The Village App: A Description

This is the API for The Village App. The Village API is hosted on Heroku and uses the NoSQL database MongoDB. The Mongoose ODM was used in conjuction with MongoDB to model the application's data. Mongoose was a great tool in organizing data, and relationships between Schemas. This application is built using RESTful routes that allows for dynamic transfer of information. The client is able to perform all necessary CRUD actions on resources and seemlessly interact with their modeled data!
